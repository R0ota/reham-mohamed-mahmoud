2 what is Code refactoring:-

Code refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of existing code without changing its external behavior. In simpler terms, it's like cleaning up or reorganizing your code to make it more readable, maintainable, and efficient—but the functionality stays the same.

1 Better Readability
Refactoring helps make the code easier to read and understand. Clear code is easier to work with and reduces confusion.

Example:
Instead of using a variable name like x, use a clear name like userEmail.
